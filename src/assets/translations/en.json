During this time, I have had the opportunity to work at several companies in the role of mobile developer, and on some occasions, also as a web developer. My specialization mainly focuses on the Flutter framework, but I have also worked as a front-end web developer using libraries like React with TypeScript. I enjoy taking on challenges that sometimes seem almost impossible to overcome, and I strive every day to conquer them. I like to share my opinions and express my perspective in any situation. When I encounter an obstacle in finding a solution, I try to step away from the problem, breathe, and return with a clearer and stronger mindset. I am in a constant learning process and am always open to feedback or criticism, as I believe they provide valuable opportunities for growth and improvement, both personally and professionally",
