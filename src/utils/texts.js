    "I have more than two years of work experience in software development, during that time I have had the opportunity to work in several companies in the role of mobile and at some point web developer. My area of ​​expertise focuses on the Flutter framework. I enjoy facing challenges that often seem almost impossible to overcome and I strive to overcome them every day. I enjoy sharing my opinions and expressing my perspective in any situation. When I encounter an obstacle to finding a solution, I try to step away from the problem, breathe, and come back stronger and clearer. I am in a constant learning process and I am always open to the opinions or criticisms of others, I believe they provide valuable opportunities for growth and personal improvement, both personally and professionally.",
